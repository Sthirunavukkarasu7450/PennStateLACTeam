# Setup

Follow the instructions here to set up the Carla sim: https://lunar-autonomy-challenge.jhuapl.edu/

Once you've verified that the sim is working do the following:

1. Open your terminal in the LAC simulator folder
2. Change directories into the `Leaderboard` folder
3. Verify that you're in the leaderboard folder. You should see something like this before the $ on the command line `~/LunarAutonomyChallenge/Leaderboard`
4. Delete everything in this directory by doing, `rm -rf`
5. Clone the repository into this folder using: `git clone https://github.com/Sthirunavukkarasu7450/PennStateLACTeam.git`
